# Team 2 Article Replication Project

## Data Acquisition
See `Macro_Data_Acquisition_Team_2` for solution of this task.

The team has gathered data on US macro time-series using `https://fred.stlouisfed.org` data.

#### Some details on the data
- GDP
- PCEC
- GDP deflator


## Data Filtering and Results Generation
See `Macro_Analysis_Team_2` for solution.

We have filtered the data to obtain detrended time series using Baxter and King filter with the same parameters as in the suggested article.

After detrending the data, our team has prepared the table analogous to table (3.b) from the article in question.
